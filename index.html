                 <h2>Global Percentage of Forest Area</h2>
                 <p>Russia is home to the largest area of forest. while Brazil, the United States, Canada, China, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo 
                   also have a largest forest area – more than 100 million hectares each.Brazil is the only other country with more than 10% of global forest cover.
                    </p>
                  <p> Global forest area has reduced significantly due to the expansion of agriculture. Today half of global habitable land is used for farming. 
                    The area used for livestock farming in particular is equal in area to the world’s forests. </p>

                 <h2>Global Forest Conversion</h2>
                 <p>Countries with a positive change (shown in green) are regrowing forest faster than they’re losing it. Countries with a negative change 
                   (shown in red) are losing more than they’re able to restore.</p>
                  <p>Every year the world loses around 5 million hectares of forest. 95% of this occurs in the tropics. At least three-quarters of this is 
                    driven by agriculture – clearing forests to grow crops, raise livestock and produce products such as paper.

                <h2>Drivers of Forest Loss in Brazil</h2>
                <p>Brazil has devoted increasing amounts of land to soy production. But has this come at the expense of forests? Has the Amazon been 
                  cleared to make room for it? It’s possible to assess whether soy production has a direct impact on deforestation, but much harder to understand whether it is 
                  indirectly causing harm elsewhere. </p>
                <p>From this, we would conclude that the dominant driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was the expansion of pasture for beef production. If we look at forest loss
                   from commercial crops – which is mainly soybeans – we see a significant decline, especially following the introduction of ‘Brazil’s Soy Moratorium’.</p>

                <h2>Palm Oil Production in South East Asia</h2>
                <p>Small amounts of palm oil are grown globally, but the global market is dominated by Indonesia and Malaysia.
                  Indonesia and Malaysia account for 63% of global land use for palm. This is low when we consider that it accounts for 84% of production. 
                  This is because both countries achieve high yields. </p>
                <p>The world devotes more than 300 million hectares for oilcrop production. Palm oil accounts for 6% of this land use, 
                  which is small when we consider that it produces 36% of the oil.</p>

                <p>Processed products include all animal feed from soybean cake (i.e. 70% of global demand); soybean oil; and industrial products such as biofuels. 
                  Direct human food includes all non-animal-sourced foods from soy excluding oils. Direct animal feed is soybeans fed directly to livestock . </p>
                <p>Global meat production has more than tripled over the last 50 years. This increase has been most marked for poultry – the largest consumer of soy feed.</p>
